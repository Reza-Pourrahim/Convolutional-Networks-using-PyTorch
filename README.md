# Convolutional Networks using PyTorch
 
we implement a convolutional neural network to perform image classification and explore
methods to improve the training performance and generalization of these networks.
We use the CIFAR-10 dataset as a benchmark for out networks. This dataset
consists of 50000 training images of 32x32 resolution with 10 object classes, namely airplanes, cars, birds, cats,
deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The task is to implement convolutional network to classify these
images using the PyTorch library. The four steps are: <br/>
- Implement the ConvNet, train it and visualizing its weights. <br/>
- Experiment with batch normalization and early stopping. <br/>
- Data augmentation and dropout to improve generalization. <br/>
- Implement transfer learning from a ImageNet pretrained model. <br/>
